title: IRI ZeroMQ Reference

# ZeroMQ

This page is a reference to the IRI ZeroMQ API. Using this allows you to get
real time updates from IRI about transactions and confirmations as well as many
other things.

By default the ZeroMQ broker, if enabled, is on port `5556`. 

<aside class="notice">
Most users are not running an IRI node locally, so you should replace
<code>http://localhost:5556</code> with that of your own node. Note that ZeroMQ
is not enabled by default.
