title: IRI API Reference

# JSON API 

This page is a reference to the IRI JSON API. There is some official
documentation out there but due to the ever-changing nature of IRI and it's API
I decided to make a community-editable documentation repo.

By default IRI listens on port `14265` for connections to its HTTP JSON API. 

<aside class="notice">
Most users are not running an IRI node locally, so you should replace
<code>http://localhost:14265</code> with that of your own node or a [public
node](https://iota.dance/nodes).
